This morning I saw a bus ad for [City
University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_University_of_Seattle)
reading "This traffic jam proves the validity of Keynesian economic
theory."

This is actually one of the better defenses I've seen of Keynesian
economics; nonetheless, there was no traffic jam at the time.
