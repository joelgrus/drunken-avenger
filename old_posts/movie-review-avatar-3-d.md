I very rarely go to the movies. Sure, I saw *Harry Potter and the
Half-Blood Prince* out of a misguided hope that they'd depart from the
source material and have Harry snog Luna, but for the most part I'd
rather stay home and watch *[Conan the
Barbarian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PQ6335puOc)* over and over
again on Netflix-on-Demand.

However, I'd heard good things about *Avatar*. For instance, it was made
by James Cameron, creator of [Jessica
Alba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Angel_%28TV_series%29). Also, it
was made in 3-D, which everyone knows is 50% better than 2-D. In
addition, I heard there was some sort of controversy involving the use
of white actors to play "Asian-inspired" characters. (For my money, the
characters were more "Amerindian-inspired" from their face paint down to
their sacred trees.) Finally, the movie was supposed to be about 8 hours
long, which meant that I'd get the most value for my movie-ticket-buying
dollar.

So, the movie is set about 150 years in the future. If you're anything
like me, you're probably wondering how things have progressed between
now and then. Here's what I know:

-   hibernation invented (or maybe stolen from bears)
-   space travel to distant planets possible
-   genetic engineering able to produce hybrids between civilized white
    people (notable for having five fingers and being civilized and
    white) and savage blue people (notable for having four fingers and
    being savage and blue)
-   mind melds invented (or maybe stolen from *Star Trek*)
-   new popular mineral:
    [unobtanium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactinide_element)
-   mild advances in helicopter technology
-   either inflation remains in check ("20 million dollars" is portrayed
    as a lot of money) or else US Dollar has been
    [redenominated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denomination_%28currency%29#Redenomination)
-   "cheddar" still used as slang for
    [riches](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cheddar)
-   invention of oversized robotic military exoskeletons, and
    correspondingly oversized military knives
-   no healthcare reform (see below)

Now then, the Blue Man lives in nets suspended from "sacred trees,"
where he carries bows and poison arrows while simultaneously respecting
all life as sacred. The sacred tree has pollen that move like jellyfish
and glow in the dark and have an affinity for the main character Sully
Sullenberger, one of the aforementioned white-blue hybrids powered by
the mind-melded brain of a paraplegic marine whose scientist twin
provided the DNA before inopportunely dying and being placed in a
cardboard box and incinerated.

Meanwhile, Sigourney Weaver is the scientist in charge of the blue-white
hybrid project, and the guy who was Phoebe's dumb half-brother on
"Friends" is the MBA-driven leader (I forget his name, but it was
something like "Piggy McGreedum" or "Spoily von Selfish") of Unobtainium
Amalgamated, and Michelle Rodriguez is a bad-ass who thinks for herself
while getting an occasional DWI, and some guy with white hair ("Killy
McKillington") is an evil military commander (but I repeat myself).

Well, it won't surprise you to learn that the biggest supply of
unobtanium within 200 klicks is located right underneath that pesky
sacred tree where the Blue Man lives. And (apparently) transportation
technology has advanced so little that killing the Blue Man and blowing
up his tree is seen as a preferable solution to just looking somewhere
else.

After a comical series of misadventures involving not-dogs and flaming
goo and rhinoceri-that-are-also-sledgehammers, Sully Sullenberger is
accepted by the Blue Man, who teach him about sharing and caring and the
wisdom of the sacred forest and how every creature has a biological
FireWire port at the end of its ponytail or one of its tendrils, which
can be linked together to share [Pure
Moods](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7zJ0yVSSvE) MP3s for
noncommercial purposes. I'm just kidding, there are no commercial
purposes among the Blue Man.

Sully's real role, of course, is to convince the Blue Man to leave his
ancestral sacred tree, so that von Selfish can get the unobtanium
without having to send in McKillington to do some McKilling. If he
succeeds, then they'll pay for doctors to fix his paraplegia, which
Obamacare apparently would not do.

It should come as no surprise to you that Sully discovers that (despite
their not having bathrooms or electricity or even YouTube, or maybe
*because of* all these things) life with the noble savage Blue Man is
better than life among the so-called "civilized" White Man.

Now, life on the Blue Man Planet is ruled by an inter-species [Antiochan
Contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioch_College#The_Sexual_Offense_Prevention_Policy),
where before jacking into and riding (e.g.) a not-horse or a
not-pterodactyl, you have to get permission from the Womyn's center.
(For no real reason, not-pterodactyls FireWire with only one Blue Man
for life; not-horses are comparatively promiscuous.) After carefully
negotiating these treacherous waters, Sully dips his quill into the blue
ink.

Where he discovers that (as they say) "Once You Go Blue, Nothing Else
Will Do," and then it's all-out warfare, with important diversions to
criticize greed, belittle terrorism, clamor for health care reform,
bemoan the fact that there was "no green" back home on earth, make
Desert Storm references, and a bunch of other things, all of which were
very loud.

The 3-D was very impressive. Not only did it not give me the headache I
was expecting (which I got from the 100dB explosions instead), but its
use was fairly restrained. (Compare with the trailer for *Tim Burton
Presents Alice in Wonderland 3D* which consisted primarily of 60 seconds
of anthropomorphic playing cards trying to stab me.)

In the end, the Tree of Souls saves the day, as do other tribes of Blue
Men ("Comanche" and "Cherokee") who ride in on not-horses and help out.
At the risk of providing spoilers, let's just say that McGreedum and
McKillington both get what they deserve for trying to rape a planet.

For some reason the movie didn't contain any references to the McDonalds
[Avatar Meal](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/12/avatar-mcdonalds/),
but that's probably because I didn't see the IMAX version (which was
sold out until approximately March).

In conclusion, did you know that they're remaking *[Clash of the
Titans](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-r6YvB5vCI)*? Bastards.
