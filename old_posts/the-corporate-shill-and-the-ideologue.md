Seattle, in case you don't follow our local politics, has got a mayoral
election going on. (Technically it was last Tuesday, but they're still
counting the ballots.)

It's a fairly interesting election, as elections go, if only because we
junked the good-for-nothing incumbent in the primary, mostly on account
of his failure ("think of the salmon!") to remove snow from our roads
last winter, which forced me to work from home for a week.

It's also fairly uninteresting, in that the two primary-survivors, the
Corporate Shill and the Ideologue, are both political neophytes. I
actually met both of them, the former during an impromptu pre-primary
baby-kissing session at Green Lake, the latter during a town hall at the
local community center. They both seemed like, well, aspiring
politicians.

And to be honest, neither is particularly appealing as a candidate.
After losing their beloved incumbent, the city's political and business
"establishment" seems to have lined up behind the Corporate Shill. So I
can't support him. On the other hand, our douchebag alterna-weekly *The
Stranger* hasn't stopped tongue-bathing the Ideologue for months. So I
can't support him either.

(My preferred candidate was the former NBA player whose campaign
platform seemed *sensible*. He came in 5th in the primary, I think.)

At last count the Ideologue is ahead by a few thousand votes, although
there are still many left to count, so anything could happen.

Nonetheless, the aforementioned douchebag alterna-weekly [makes the
point](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/meet-your-new-mayor/Content?oid=2647953)
that under either administration, the city council (and in particular
its president) is poised to control an outsized share of the power in
the city. This is probably the case, and I'm sure that any one of the
three would continue the current policies of running the city into the
ground.

There is one part of the article that leapt out at me as being, well,
weird:

> [City council president] Conlin sees the city pulling itself out of
> the gutter by embracing the most progressive elements of his
> environmental agenda. For example, a company called General
> Biodiesel—which uses primarily waste fats like cooking grease and
> tallow—was having a hard time getting permits, Conlin said, and by
> removing red tape Seattle was able to help that company (and,
> hopefully, laid down a marker that will help attract other green-job
> companies). "We should be targeting companies like that and asking,
> 'What can we do to help you?'" he said.

I had to read this paragraph several times, because I wasn't sure what
part of was "progressive." Nominally, it's a story about *making it
easier to do business* and in particular *relaxing a permitting*
process. These are both pretty
[anti-progressive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States#Regulation_of_large_corporations_and_monopolies)
positions, so I can't imagine that's what he was referring to.

Instead, I figure, what he *really* meant was something along the lines
of "let companies whose names contain green-sounding terms like
'Biodiesel' and 'Renewable' and 'Sustainable' ignore laws and
regulations that apply to other, less-SWPL-friendly companies." And
indeed, this is the sort of Seattle "progressivism" I've gotten used to.

In anticipation of this new agenda, I'm thinking about renaming my
publishing company to something more progressive, like "Compostable
House," "Biodegraded Books," or "Post-Industrial Press."
