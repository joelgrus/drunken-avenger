The government has a CIO, it turns out, and when he's not hassling us to
change our passwords *again* or to stop BitTorrenting on company time,
he's got a plan to [re-invent government
itself](http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/americas-new-cio-wants-to-disrupt-government-and-make-it-a-startup.php):

No one can argue that he doesn't grasp the lingo. However, a [career
Microsoftie](http://www.cio.gov/profile/VanRoekel-Steven.cfm) is maybe
not the best choice to run anything in "lean startup mode". As someone
with a fair amount of startup experience, I offer him the following
pieces of advice:

**1. Never say "lean startup mode" (or "agile" or "mashed up")**

Each of these buzzwords sends a clear signal that either you've been in
a coma since 2006 or that your "startup experience" consists entirely of
eavesdropping at a coffee shop where programmers hang out.

**2. Also, "mobile apps" are very 2009**

I'm not saying you couldn't hit the jackpot and sell several million
copies of "Angry Birds D.C." or "Laws with Friends" or even "Doodle
Congress". But the odds are against you.

**3. Startups have to *convince* investors to give them money**

This is part of what makes startups startups. It's tough to stay "lean"
and "agile" (let alone "mashed up") if you can simply close a funding
round at gunpoint each April 15^1^. If VanRoekel can somehow make it so
that government has to make PowerPoint slides and beg us for money each
time it needs some, that would be a huge win.

**4. Startups have to at least *pretend* to have a revenue model**

It doesn't have to be completely realistic. It can in fact be pretty
ludicrous, like "we'll sell '\$50 of junk for only \$25' coupons and
then only give the merchants *half* of the \$25."

But it does have to involve *revenue*. For instance, "we'll use the
funds to subsidize our friends' failing businesses and also to bail out
our other friends' failed businesses and then to send troops to Africa
and then finally to imprison some recreational drug users" is not a
revenue model. Could you maybe add some sort of group shopping
component?

**5. Startups need an "elevator pitch"**

At some point you'll be in an elevator with someone, and he'll ask you
what your startup does, and you'll have to explain it to him in terms of
something he already knows (and recognizes as a success for venture
capital).

For instance, a startup might be "Flickr but for dogs" or "Facebook but
for cats" or "Pets.com but for group shopping deals."

Obviously, none of these describes the federal government. Coming up
with these analogies is more of an art than a science, but you might
consider "Enron but bigger" or "Swoopo but mandatory" or "Pets.com but
with guns and a no-knock warrant".

**6. Startups fire people**

Part of being "lean" and "agile" and "mashed up" is that you can't
afford to keep the wrong people \*cough\* Tim Geithner \*cough\* Janet
Napolitano \*cough\* Eric Holder \*cough\* Steven Chu \*cough\* in their
jobs when they suck at them. If the CIO is empowered to make this
change, then good for him!

**7. Startups have a "fun" culture**

**8. Startups usually fail and go out of business**

I'd be lying if I said this wasn't the most exciting part of the
"government as startup" plan.

<small>1. Can we dispense with the fiction that taxes are due on April
15? Multiple times I paid my taxes by April 15 and yet was still
"penalized" because I didn't "estimate" and "prepay" them
sooner.</small>
