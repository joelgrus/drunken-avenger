There are a number of somewhat incredible articles floating around about
[the grotesque insolvency of the state of
Illinois](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38072919/ns/business-the_new_york_times/).
Many parts are appalling, but what leapt out at me most was the
following:

> The state’s last elected governor, Rod R. Blagojevich, is on trial for
> racketeering and extortion. But in 2003, he persuaded the legislature
> to let him float \$10 billion in 30-year bonds and use the proceeds
> for two years of pension payments.
>
> That gamble backfired and wound up costing the state many billions of
> dollars.

Based on a quick sampling of [Illinois
legislators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_House_of_Representatives#Members_of_the_Illinois_House_of_Representatives),
this multi-billion-dollar bet was approved by a combination of
[lawyers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Madigan),
[policemen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Acevedo#Early_life),
[schoolteachers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaShawn_Ford), and
[bricklayers](http://www.ilga.gov/house/Rep.asp?MemberID=1336).

Now, lawyers are supposed to be good at suing people. Policemen are
supposed to be good at [punching
jaywalkers](http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/06/14/q13-fox-news-seattle-police-officer-assaults-17-year-old-jaywalker).
Bricklayers are supposed to be good at laying bricks. Schoolteachers are
supposed to be good at ... um ... something, I'm sure.

But there's no reason to expect any of them to be good at *making
multi-billion-dollar-bets with other people's money*. If one weren't
blinded by status quo bias, one might observe that a system that not
only allows them to do so but *encourages* them to do so is, in some
fundamental way, broken.

To his credit, even the President [acknowledges
this](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-wall-street-reform):

> As you know, part of what led to this crisis was [states like

What's that? You say he was actually talking about *private firms*
making bets with *their own money*? Well, in that case he ought to be
even more critical of state legislatures doing the same thing. He is,
isn't he? I mean, it's not like he was a *member* of the Illinois Senate
when they took this multi-billion-dollar bet. He wasn't, was he?
