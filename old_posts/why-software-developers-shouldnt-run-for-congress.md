Over on his blog, Clay Johnson gives five reasons why software
developers [ought to run for
Congress](http://infovegan.com/2010/07/19/why-developers-should-run-for-congress):

1\. They're underrepresented. (Similarly, so are [people without college
degrees](http://www.scrippsnews.com/content/5-percent-congress-lack-college-degree),
so perhaps they ought to run too.)

2\. Congress could use their expertise. For example, think about the
more-than-1000-page Stimulus Bill. Not only does it monkey in an
unintended-consequences kind of way with multi-billion-dollar swaths of
the economy, it also contains a poorly written website spec for
recovery.gov! If we had more developers in Congress, perhaps the bill
would only do the former.

3\. Software developers like solving problems, and will make the Congress
more efficient at doing what it does. Like, maybe instead of just
posting self-serving press releases on their websites, they can add them
their Twitter feeds as well. Rather than ignoring their constituents'
letters and phone calls, they can ignore their emails and tweets. Rather
than arbitrarily deciding where to allocate waste-of-taxpayer-money pork
funds, they'll write software programs that use "algorithms" to decide
where to waste our money. The possibilities are endless.

4\. They'd probably staff their offices with other software developers,
who would not only Rails-ify House Subcommittee websites that no one
cares about, they'd also be much less likely to [sue the taxpayers for
sexual
harassment](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/39637.html).
Everyone wins.

5\. Software developers are great communicators! Sure, they use too many
acronyms, and they tend to stare at their shoes instead of making eye
contact, and they're afraid of girls, and they prefer instant messaging
to actual conversation. But they're also much better at foursquare
("Congressman Jones is now Mayor of [D.C.
Madam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Jeane_Palfrey)") and they'd
probably update their blogs a lot more frequently.

The blog post doesn't mention it, but there are also some good reasons
why software developers *shouldn't* run for Congress.

1\. Congressmen spend most of their time raising money, which will bring
back all those bad memories of your last failed startup.

2\. Not only does Congress not provide free sodas, they're always [trying
to tax
them](http://healthbistro.lifescript.com/2010/06/08/soda-taxes-gain-weight-with-congress/)!

3\. (\# of foosball tables in Capitol) + (\# of XBOX 360s in Capitol) +
(\# of ball pits in Capitol) = 0

4\. Terrible iPhone reception in Congressional office buildings.

5\. Software developers hate bullshit; Congress non-stop bullshit.
