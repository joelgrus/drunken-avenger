There are various opinions and debates over the "proper" roles of
government, but I'm pretty sure that [combing the Indian Ocean to find a
missing 16-year-old who's sailing around the world by herself in order
to break a world
record](http://www.seattlepi.com/national/1110ap_us_girls_solo_voyage.html)
isn't one of them:

I hope the girl is OK and everything, but the State Department and Coast
Guard better send the bill to her family, not to the rest of us.
