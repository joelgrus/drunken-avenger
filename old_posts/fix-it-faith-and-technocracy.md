Tonight at dinner I ~~started~~ got into an extended argument about
[technocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy), during which it
was asserted to me that whatever faults I might find with our government
could be quickly resolved if only we started electing really brilliant
people to office.

This not uncommon belief that enlightened technocrats and politicians
could easily solve complex problems demonstrates what the *New York
Times* calls [Fix-It
Faith](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/weekinreview/30rosenthal.html):

> Americans have long had an unswerving belief that technology will save
> us — it is the cavalry coming over the hill, just as we are about to
> lose the battle. And yet ... over the past month it became apparent
> that our great belief in technology was perhaps misplaced.

This is a refreshing admission from the *Times*. I bet they're referring
to the panoply of [unintended
consequences](http://www.jsonline.com/business/95160924.html) that are
turning up in the ([based on
science](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5111374-503544.html))
Health Care Reform bill they advocated for.

Wait, did I say the article was about politicians? I meant to say that
it was about deep sea drilling:

Nonetheless, with his science background, his faith that "[improved
procedures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater)" will surely
stop the next disaster, his demonstrated facility at writing off
[unexpected
consequences](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/01/the-law-of-unin.html)
of risky projects as "beyond the realm of expectation," and his
inability to imagine errors, he totally could be a technocratic
politician.

If only they'd thought to ask whether he has any really clever ideas on
financial reform or carbon rationing.
