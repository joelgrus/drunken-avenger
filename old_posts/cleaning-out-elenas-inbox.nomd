The [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/) has set up
[Elena's Inbox](http://www.elenasinbox.com/), a site that makes it
easy[er] to browse through the dump of Elena Kagan's Clinton-era emails.

However, it looks like they've certainly held something back. Can it
really be that she sent no emails containing
"[lol](http://www.elenasinbox.com/search/?q=lol)" or
"[rofl](http://www.elenasinbox.com/search/?q=rofl)" or
"[omg](http://www.elenasinbox.com/search/?q=omg)"?
