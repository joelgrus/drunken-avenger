Megan McArdle has just returned from a time-machine visit to the year
2000, [and she's worried about a new scourge called
Napster](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/05/the-freeloaders/8027/):

Possibly she met with Jack Valenti when she was there, because she's
returned with his trademark pessimism about the ability of markets to
find common ground between buyers and sellers.

Such a narrow defeatism! Along similar lines, can't we also admit that
we may never find a way to reconcile workers who want high wages with
employers who'd prefer low? Where's the *Atlantic* column complaining
about this?

Or maybe McArdle is just talking her book?

"Sure, the internet has brought to the fingertips of billions of people
an unimaginable wealth of information, a cosmic jukebox, texts and
videos that otherwise might have been lost to the ages, a free
encyclopedia, tool-assisted speedruns of old Nintendo games, and the
greatest marketplace the world has ever seen, but won't someone please
think of the *Atlantic* bloggers?"

I wonder if the
[loom-smashers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite#History) wrote
similar columns.

Always? Really? I suspect [Mick
Jagger](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/05/mick-jagger-on-the-economics-of-music.html)
might disagree, although he probably doesn't know as much about the
music business as McArdle does.

Because the band ("Atlanta's Best Party Band!") that my sister hired to
play her wedding certainly wasn't starving, and they didn't seem to have
their sights set any higher than being Atlanta's Best Party Band. My
friend who put out a Facebook message to recruit for her would-be lounge
band doesn't dream of anything more than playing a few shows, nor does
another friend whose cover band plays at Rock Bottom Brewery once a
month. My other sister writes songs and puts them on her website with no
motivation other than entertaining people who download them.

Quite possibly most musicians *hope* to make it rich. Almost everyone
*hopes* to make it rich. But that doesn't mean that's the only thing
that motivates them, and it certainly doesn't mean they'll quit what
they're doing if their lottery ticket up and vanishes.

Isn't it? Well, here's a subject I happen to know something about,
because a year is just about how much time I spent writing *[Your
Religion Is
False](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982481802?ie=UTF8&tag=brightwalton-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0982481802)*.
Of course, the whole time I had "prospects" of financial return, but I
certainly didn't have any guarantees. No one promised me I'd make a
single dollar, and no one promised me I'd sell a single copy. **That's
why I didn't quit my day job**. (Until much later, when I quit my day
job.)

Most musicians have day jobs. Most writers have day jobs. Most actors
have day jobs. McArdle is astoundingly fortunate that someone pays her a
salary (I assume) simply to write blog posts all day. But this makes her
a fantastic outlier.

All artists want to get paid for their art. I want to get paid for my
art. And of course I'd rather someone pay me for a copy of my book than
read it for free. But if the choice is between "someone reading it for
free" and "someone not reading it at all," I'll take the former 100
times out of 100. And if the choice is between "lots of people reading
it for free" and "no one reading it at all," it's a complete no-brainer.

For without the internet and what it enables, I never could have written
*Your Religion Is False*. I never could have published it, I never could
have effectively promoted it, and I never could have sold the number of
copies that I have. I never could have quit my job to try to make a
living as a writer, and the world would never get to enjoy the multiple
(awesome) books that I'm working on.

Perhaps the internet hurts the business model for McArdle's creative
output. But at the same time, it *makes possible* the business model for
mine, and for countless others like me. Shouldn't someone who calls
herself "Jane Galt" have a little more appreciation for the
essential-to-capitalism process of creative destruction?
