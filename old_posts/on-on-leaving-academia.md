Several people in my influencesphere have linked to [this
essay](http://cs.unm.edu/~terran/academic_blog/?p=113) by a CS prof
who's leaving academia to join Google in order to "make a positive
difference in the world." I am, of course, wholly supportive of such a
program, if not of his precise rationale, which is a mish-mash of
ranting about wicked Republicans and wild-eyed idealism about the
Academy.

What interests me most about his essay is the section entitled "Mass
Production Of Education", which is misguided in all the ways you'd
expect from someone steeped in the culture of
"[bespoke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bespoke)" education. It lists
three "worries":

> First, I worry that mass-production here will have the same effect
> that it has had on manufacturing for over two centuries:
> administrators and regents, eager to save money, will push for ever
> larger remote classes and fewer faculty to teach them.

Said differently, technologies that allow fewer faculty to teach the
same number of students will allow universities to operate with fewer
faculty. Let's call this worry
"[Luddism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite)". I love a good
loom-smashing as much as the next guy, but it's sort of hard to take
seriously a preference for the 19th-century manufacturing regime.

It seems likely that in a hundred years our grandchildren and those of
us who've successfully been cryonically revived will share a laugh about
how "education" used to involve crowding people into a room and making
them sit still while someone stood up front and lectured at them. And
then someone will brain-cast a ludicrous hyper-essay about how 4-D
printing is democratizing the singularity, pining for the good old days
of 3-D printing. And so on.

Said differently (and with apologies to UNM, which I'm sure is a fine
school), if every student has access to cheap, high-quality education,
few of them will choose to pursue a low-quality education. It is easy to
see how purveyors of low-quality education might worry about this, but
it's hard to imagine why anyone else should.

Seems pretty unlikely, but if we were that would be *awesome* because it
would free up all the other computer science Ph.D.s, many of whom are
brilliant, to *do other stuff* (like building Groupon and Pinterest
clones)! This would be sad for the ones who really, really, really want
to be teachers, but on balance it would be a huge win for the world.

I have no idea how to say this differently, so I won't try. Having been
a teacher, I agree that the *most rewarding* moments happened between
individuals. (Particularly when one of the individuals was the cute goth
freshman girl who aced all the quizzes but still came to office hours.)
Were those the *most valuable* parts of the teaching experience? Less
clear. What's more clear is that what was/is most valuable about my
experience as a *student* was/is *learning stuff*. And these days most
of what I know that's useful I've learned from books or doing or even
Coursera, not from the academy. I've broadened my horizons by pleasure
reading, by arguing on LiveJournal, by discussions with peers on geek
hikes far more than I ever did through school. With very few exceptions,
my most profound intellectual connections have been with people I met
outside of the school system.

I suspect you have to have spent your whole life in academia to
seriously assert that "the human connection in education" is the only
path to these things, or even the easiest path to these things. College
taught me how to play the same juvenile bulshytt status games we played
in high school but at a slightly higher level. College professors were
(sometimes) great role models for how to behave if you ever became a
college professor, but not for much else. The levels of professionality
and intellectual maturity I experienced in the academy were certainly no
greater than I've experienced in the real world. I will freely admit to
learning rigor (some would say too much rigor) while studying
mathematics, which primed me to recognize the lack of rigor in so many
other fields.

Said differently, "we fear change". Hopefully at Google he'll learn to
stop saying "democratize", and maybe he'll even meet a Republican or
two. There must be one or two Republicans at Google, right?
