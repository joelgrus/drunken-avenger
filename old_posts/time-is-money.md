I just had an awesome idea for getting the economy going again. Instead
of trading *money* for things, we'll just trade "time" for things. I
know what you're thinking -- that sounds a lot like
[barter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter) and we'll just run into
the [double coincidence of wants
problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants). But I've
thought up an extra twist. We'll make up certificates, and each one is
good for an hour worth of labor, any labor. We'll use them like money,
except that they'll be more ...
[fun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_dollar#Parodies).

I know, I know, you're thinking this will never work, because
low-skilled people will take advantage of the system by earning their
hours doing something "money-cheap" like pet-sitting and then spending
them on something "money-expensive" like wedding photography.

But, see, I know a guy at the Associated Press, and I bet I can get him
to write an article [celebrating how much money the advantage-takers are
saving by using "time
dollars"](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100603/ap_on_re_us/us_banking_time)
without even mentioning that (necessarily) people on the other sides of
the transactions must be losing just as much:

What's more, if she were using wicked regular dollars, then (assuming
she could still trick people into trading expensive things for
inexpensive things) she might be saving money at the expense of
strangers or faceless corporations or maybe even foreigners. But thanks
to the magic of time dollars, she's saving money that might have gone to
people in her own community. That makes her part of [The Circle of
Giving](http://www.timebanks.org/neighbor-to-neighbor.htm)!
