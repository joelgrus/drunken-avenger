If you have been living in a cave without Internet access, you might not
be aware of Google Plus, which you might think of as Google's answer to
Facebook (if Facebook were a question). After playing around with it a
bit, it seems to have several advantages:

-   not operated by Facebook
-   your relatives aren't on it yet
-   90% of posts are about hot topics like Google Plus and how to use
    Google Plus and how cool Google Plus is, not boring topics like
    "pictures of my kids"
-   are able to "follow" people who aren't actually your friends, which
    means you can get topics in your feed other than the Paleo diet,
    cryonics, and the Reichart and Garrett show
-   and most importantly, circles

Whereas Facebook makes you lump all your friends together in one feed,
Google lets you segregate them into circles for browsing and sharing. If
you curate correctly, it's easy to share links only with the "Asian
females" circle and to browse only the "people on my kickball team that
I like" circle.

Unfortunately, at this early stage of the game you cannot *nest*
circles, which means it's important to partition your friends correctly.
After a lot of trial and error, I've found the following scheme of
circles works pretty well for me:

-   Asian females
-   People who hate libertarians but put up with me for some unspecified
    reason
-   People on my kickball team that I like
-   People on my kickball team towards whom I'm ambivalent
-   Former bosses
-   People who post about things currently happening at the college we
    attended, even though we all graduated 15 years ago
-   Jackie Passey
-   Tall people
-   People that I don't know who they are, but we have a lot of friends
    in common, so I'll pretend like I do know who they are, because
    probably I'm supposed to
-   Fictional characters
-   Kirez
-   People I met at the Rudy Ray Moore concert
-   Everyone else

If there's a downside to Google Plus, it's that it's a lot of work to
check it all the time, and to casually brag about how many people are
adding to me to their circles, and to ask everyone their heights so that
I know whether to put them in the "Tall people" circle or the "Jackie
Passey" circle. Nonetheless, it's pretty clear at this point that
circles are the wave of the future, which means that my decades-long
investment in analytic geometry is about to pay off!
