I give <a href = "http://joelgrus.com/speaking/">talks</a>,
and this fall my talk has been to live code a deep learning
library (and use the resulting library to solve
<a href = "http://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/">Fizz Buzz</a>).

You probably didn't get to see my talk,
which is why I made a
<a href = "https://youtu.be/o64FV-ez6Gw">video of it</a>:
