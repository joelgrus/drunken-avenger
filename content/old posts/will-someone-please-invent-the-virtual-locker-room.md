Bill Gates, always a man with big ideas, suspects that the internet is
going to shake up our educational system:

> “Five years from now on the web for free you’ll be able to find the
> best lectures in the world,” Gates said at the Techonomy conference in
> Lake Tahoe, CA today. “It will be better than any single university,”
> he continued.

In fact, this is already true today. When I used to bus-commute across
the bridge, every bus ride that I didn't spend reading pirated
young-adult *Star Wars* novellas or playing "Angry Birds" I spent
watching "iTunes U" lectures from Stanford and MIT and iPorn about
"Machine Learning" and "Computer Science" and "The Naked Female Body."
If only I could somehow put these on my resume, I'd be able to talk my
way into all sorts of jobs I'm not really qualified to do. BillG has got
a plan for that too:

> He believes that no matter how you came about your knowledge, you
> should get credit for it. Whether it’s an MIT degree or if you got
> everything you know from lectures on the web, there needs to be a way
> to highlight that.

Now, there is a [cynical school of
thought](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_%28economics%29#Assumptions_and_groundwork)
that says that the value of a MIT degree is not that it signals that you
learned dozens of MIT-lecture-worths of things; rather, it's that it
signals that you *were admitted to and jumped through all the hoops
necessary to survive four years at MIT*, in which case the hypothetical
third-party credentials "watched a bunch of MIT lectures on the bus"
probably aren't that useful to employers.

Furthermore, being lectured at is frequently not the best way to learn
something. Nonetheless, I join BillG in applauding this trend. If it
puts competitive pressure on colleges, it will be a good thing.

It seems to me that it's even more promising for K-12 education. Rather
than having centrally-assigned, underqualified teachers trying to
lecture 30 students who learn at varying paces (and several of whom are
disruptive), each student could find the lecturer and lecture style that
works best for him. In many cases these might be no lectures at all.
Think of the innovations that would ensue! I bet BillG is most excited
about this:

> He made sure to say that educational institutions are still vital for
> children, K-12. He spoke glowingly about charter schools, where kids
> can spend up to 80% of their time deeply engaged with learning.
>
> But college needs to be less “place-based,” according to Gates. Well,
> except for the parties, he joked.

Wait, what? K-12 education needs to be "place-based"? I mean, I
understand that the internet can't yet teach kids valuable life skills
like "staying in your seat" and "raising your hand before you speak" and
"not going to the bathroom without getting permission first" and
"getting duct-taped to a bench in the locker room for being too slow at
running laps." But surely virtual locker rooms and virtual duct tape are
only a few years away!

(Also, for those of you who don't know, I am delighted to report that
the post-college years contain a huge number of parties, including
Oktoberfests, Nights of Decadence, 80's Parties, Bacchinaliae,
Shut-up-and-Drinks, and Lovett Casino Parties.)

It's tough to assert with a straight face that competition (from the
internet or otherwise) will provide vast benefits for students in grades
13-16, but has no role to play in grades K-12. If Bill ever decides to
spend his vast fortunes improving education, hopefully he'll revisit his
opinion on this first, before he wastes billions of dollars.
