I live in a city that's full of Obama supporters. (The two notable
exceptions are me and the guy in front of me on the freeway the other
day with three different Dennis Kucinich stickers on his car.) And so
during the 2008 elections I had ample opportunities to ask questions
about why people supported him.

"Aren't you concerned," I would often ask, "that he doesn't have much
useful experience *running* anything? Is being a law professor and a
Senator really useful preparation for being chief executive of
Leviathan?"

"I see what you're saying," they'd inevitably answer, "but look at the
streamlined, coolly effective campaign he's running. That's all the
evidence I need of his executive skills."

Accordingly, now that his executive skills are [coming into
question](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/Spill-reveals-Obama_s-lack-of-executive-experience-95819074.html)
due to his perceived lack of leadership on the BP oil disaster, I humbly
suggest that he demonstrate leadership by returning to his roots:

-   use the internet and social media to recruit a virtual army of 18 to
    29 year olds, who all [probably have nothing better to
    do](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/03/24/90996/tight-job-market-is-squeezing.html)
    than scrubbing rocks and geese anyway
-   revamp the Neighbor-to-Neighbor tool on
    [my.barackobama.com](http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/ofasplashrecoverymay)
    to make it easier for volunteers to organize "house parties" where
    they can brainstorm with the neighbors for clever ways to stop the
    oil from spreading further
-   commission an [iconic logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama_logo)
    for the Gulf cleanup efforts:

-   I don't know if a video of [Obama
    girl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Got_a_Crush..._on_Obama)
    covered in oil would help, but it certainly couldn't hurt!
-   create a catchy slogan. Something like "Ecological Change We Can
    Believe In" or "Yes BP Can!" or "Si BP Puede!"
-   maybe some sort of Shepard Fairey poster? I'm thinking maybe a
    picture of Andre the Giant and then the word
    "[BOOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_%28containment%29)"
    underneath.

-   finally, just in case none of the previous approaches to leadership
    helps, I suggest some sort of [music
    video](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_We_Can) featuring hip-hop
    stars and celebrity actors. If that doesn't work, nothing will!
