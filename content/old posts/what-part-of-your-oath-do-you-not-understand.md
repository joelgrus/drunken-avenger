I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to something something anymore!

It all started with Wil Wheaton^1^, who used to be the bartender (I
believe) on "Star Trek", but who is now some sort of Twitter celebrity.
I myself have zero tolerance for Twitter celebrities, but one of the
"data scientists" I follow "retweeted" the following into my newshose:

> Dear Congress and President Obama: What part of your oath to uphold
> and defend the Constitution do you not understand?
> [\#SOPA](https://twitter.com/search/%2523SOPA)
> [\#NDAA](https://twitter.com/search/%2523NDAA)

The SOPA/NDAA, in case you have more important things to do than follow
politics, is the latest power grab by the content industries, and would
allow the President to use unmanned drones to assassinate you and/or the
Internet without a trial if he suspects you're selling counterfeit
handbags or illegally downloading Hall & Oates MP3s or waging jihad. It
is indeed an abomination, which is why it is only supported by
heartless, baby-killing monsters like record company executives and
United States Senators. And it certainly seems plausible that a
President who signed such a bill would be in violation of his oath to
"defend the Constitution."

You know what else is in violation of his oath to defend the
Constitution? JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING HE'S EVER DONE. Invade Libya without
declaring war? [NOT IN THE
CONSTITUTION](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20045927-503544.html).
Illegally traffic guns to criminals in order to drum up popular support
for eviscerating the Second Amendment? [NOT IN THE
CONSTITUTION](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31727_162-57338546-10391695/documents-atf-used-fast-and-furious-to-make-the-case-for-gun-regulations/).
Override state medical marijuana laws? [NOT IN THE
CONSTITUTION](http://blog.norml.org/2011/11/07/norml-attorneys-file-multiple-constitutional-challenges-to-federal-medical-marijuana-crackdown/).
Force people to buy private health insurance? [NOT IN THE
CONSTITUTION](http://www.detnews.com/article/20111129/MIVIEW/111290378/Obamacare-s-Constitutional-malpractice).
And so on. If it takes the NDAA to get you to care about Obama's oath to
defend the Constitution, then either you've been living in a cave in
Pakistan for the past 3 years, or YOU DON'T ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE
CONSTITUTION.

As it happens, I'm not one of those libertarian types who pounds the
table about what is and what isn't in the Constitution. Of course I'd
rather the government lived up to its promises not to quarter soldiers
in my condo, not to take away my guns, and not to censor my <span
style="background-color: rgb(0,0,0);">XXXXXXXXXXX</span>. But they
don't, and no one seems to care that they don't, and in fact most people
are quite happy to let the government quarter soldiers in their condos
as long as it gets them something they want, like endless war in
Afghanistan, or [patents on being aware of medical best
practices](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/12/oblivious-supreme-court-poised-to-legalize-medical-patents.ars),
or subsidized pharmaceuticals for wealthy old people. In any event, I
don't treat the Constitution as holy writ, or think something is
necessarily a good idea because it's in the Constitution or necessarily
a bad idea because it's not, or consider it a good use of anyone's time
to yell "READ THE CONSTITUTION!" to people who don't particular care
about what's in the Constitution.

But I will pound the table when some

[juvenile-name-calling](http://wilwheaton.tumblr.com/post/5405710710/teabaggers-new-constitutional-amendment-give-states)
Twitter celebrity suddenly starts chastising people as if *in this one
case* the Constitution is the most important thing in the world. You
don't get to do that. If you didn't care about the Constitution back
when activist judges insisted that deep in its penumbrae one could
divine secret rights to funnel taxpayer money to politically-connected
banks and carbuilding unions, then no one is going to take you seriously
when you pretend to care about it now. Oh, they'll pretend to care about
your pretending, and maybe they'll even mention to their friends that
"that bartender from the Starship Enterprise had some great tweet where
he pretended like he cares about the Constitution, and he used
\#hashtags and everything, and it was really such a stellar example of
pretending to care about the Constitution that I favorited it *and*
retweeted it *and* @replied to it, so you should check it out!" But they
know that you're posturing and that you know perfectly well that the
President and the Congress perfectly well *understand* their oath to
"uphold the Constitution", they JUST DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS ABOUT IT,
and they also know that 364 days out of the year NEITHER DO YOU.

What's extra-sad is that this guy had a particularly unpleasant run-in
with the TSA last spring:

You'd think that might have indicated to him that the "teabaggers'" fear
of government power was maybe not so off-base after all. The bartenders
at the places *I* hang out certainly would have noticed this, so maybe
it's that all the cosmic rays in space kill brain cells.

All that said, the NDAA and SOPA are both horrible laws and we're worse
as a society for passing them (or for being about to pass them) and the
people defending them are heartless, baby-killing monsters who you
should probably go out of your way to spit on if you encounter them. But
they're also perfectly predictable consequences of having the kind of
busybody government that you've been loudly clamoring for your whole
life. It wasn't so long ago that you were blogging a stupid "CHANGE WE
CAN BELIEVE IN" graphic and telling people to vote for this jerk. To the
extent you care about preventing the next SOPA, you might consider next
time listening to the libertarians instead of just calling them vulgar
names and putting sugar in their gas tanks.

<small>1. Technically, it started when I read the article about Sheila
Jackson-Lee stopping a SOPA hearing so they could discuss whether
someone had insulted her on Twitter, and I
[realized](https://www.facebook.com/joel.grus/posts/263520840367798)
that I was the one with the "crazy" politics for not being eager to
subject myself to thousands of pages of laws written by emotional
preschoolers.</small>
