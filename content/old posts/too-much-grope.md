The last time I flew anywhere was ~~January~~ May 2010, which predated
all of the "don't touch my junk" craziness, toward which I've maintained
an extremely passive sense of outrage.

Somehow I assumed that only some small fraction of travelers were
getting X-rayed, but I arrived at Sea-Tac this afternoon and discovered
that every security line was being routed through an imposing-looking
"RAPISCAN" machine.

I stuck my computer and luggage and shoes on the belt and then
cheerfully informed the TSA lady that I didn't want to be X-rayed.

She gave me her best "are you fucking kidding me?" look, shunted me off
to the side, and then told her compatriot "we've got an *opt-out*." She
said "opt-out" in the same tone that a teenager might say "mom, you're
*embarrassing* me."

So I stood there and stood there and stood there, all the while my
computer and luggage and shoes were sitting unattended on the far side
of security, until finally the TSA lady from the next line over noticed
me and asked if I was "an opt-out," after which she fetched a male
groper.

The groping itself wasn't too bad. The TSA guy who did the groping was
polite enough, I guess. The *idea* of getting groped bothered me, but
apart from that it wasn't particularly upsetting. I don't, however, look
forward to explaining to little Joelene why the TSA agent gets an
exception to the "no one should ever touch you like that" rule.

Anyway, other than the first TSA lady's *look* they didn't give me much
trouble for opting out. If any part of it was distressing, it was this:
the whole time (\~10 minutes) I was hanging around the security
stations, not one other person opted out.
