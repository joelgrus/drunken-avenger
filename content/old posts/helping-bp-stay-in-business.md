In an upcoming *New York Times* piece, David Leonhardt points out that
[people aren't good at reasoning about low-probability
events](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/magazine/06fob-wwln-t.html?hp):

> We make two basic — and opposite — types of mistakes. When an event is
> difficult to imagine, we tend to underestimate its likelihood. This is
> the proverbial black swan. Most of the people running Deepwater
> Horizon probably never had a rig explode on them. So they assumed it
> would not happen, at least not to them.
>
> [...]
>
> On the other hand, when an unlikely event is all too easy to imagine,
> we often go in the opposite direction and overestimate the odds. After
> the 9/11 attacks, Americans canceled plane trips and took to the road.
> There were no terrorist attacks in this country in 2002, yet the
> additional driving apparently led to an increase in traffic

I would probably call these the [same
mistake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic), rather
than two different ones, but that's a minor quibble. I'll also avoid
taking issue with his references to the "true probability" of an event,
which would probably take us into areas [too
philosophical](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/probability-interpret/#SubPro)
for a family-friendly blog such as this one.

A more major quibble is with the following:

> When the stakes are high enough, it falls to government to help its
> citizens avoid these entirely human errors. The market, left to its
> own devices, often cannot do so.

I'm not sure which government Leonhardt is thinking of, but the only
ones I'm familiar with are made up of *humans* who routinely commit, um,
"entirely human errors."

I'm willing to agree that "markets" are pretty lousy at predicting the
odds of never-before-seen events -- though BP's safety procedures are
presumably set through some combination of BP internal policy (not a
market) and government regulation (also not a market). But are
governments any better at predicting the odds of never-before-seen
events?

The article admits that maybe they're not:

> Yet in the case of Deepwater Horizon, government policy actually went

> In a little-noticed provision in a 1990 law passed after the Exxon

Exxon Mobil earns [\$6 billion](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=XOM) a
quarter. \$75 million is about 1% of this amount. Even if you have an
oil spill every quarter, that damage cap is a rounding error to profits.
It might as well not exist.

In fact, if you dig deeper, this has nothing to do with cognitive error
at all. It's not that people working in government can't estimate the
odds of a spill, it's that they're more concerned that [their friends in
the oil industry don't suffer too much when a spill inevitably
occurs](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-14/effort-to-raise-oil-spill-liability-fails-in-senate-update1-.html):

Yes, well, it's also an effective way to ensure that they take more
huge-downside risks than they would if you didn't cap their damages. But
the important thing is that they stay in business! Just like the
important thing was that AIG stay in business, and that GM stay in
business, and that Fannie Mae stay in business.

In *markets*, companies fail. Companies that can't meet their
liabilities go out of business, and new companies replace them. That's
how *markets* work. That's the discipline that markets rely on. Those
are the incentives that proponents of markets have in mind.

Because when you artificially insulate companies from the consequences
of their actions, that's not a market. It's a recipe for reckless
risk-taking and gross malfeasance.

To be sure, I'm not claiming that absent this 1990 law and similar
policies, BP would have made smart decisions about the drilling risks
they took. But they almost certainly would have made smart*er*
decisions.

If only there were a term for the cognitive bias [wherein one
systematically overestimates the odds that a law written by self-serving
politicians is likely to make a complex situation
better](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking).
