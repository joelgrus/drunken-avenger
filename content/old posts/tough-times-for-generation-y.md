Another day, another [sob
story](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/business/economy/07generation.html?ref=general&src=me&pagewanted=all)
in the *New York Times*. Today's involves Scott Nicholson, who -- like
so many in his "lost generation" -- had his expensive political science
degree completely paid for by his grandparents, turned down a \$40k/year
job because it was less than his brother makes, and gets his parents to
pay his rent while they direct their attention "mainly at sustaining
[his] self-confidence."

> Of the 20 college classmates with whom he keeps up, 12 are working,
> but only half are in jobs they “really like.” Three are entering law
> school this fall after frustrating experiences in the work force, “and
> five are looking for work just as I am,” he said.

Although the *Times* reporter didn't mention what these "frustrating
experiences" were, my suspicion is that they were some combination of

-   being reprimanded for spending too much time on Facebook and not
    enough time working
-   co-workers inexplicably unimpressed by constant bragging about
    "dean's award for academic excellence"
-   office manager's persistent refusal to switch from cheap Costco
    coffee beans to expensive shade-grown, "fair trade" coffee beans
-   occasional failings incompatible with unshakeable sense of
    self-esteem
-   "How are mommy and daddy supposed to help me get my work done when
    the IT department won't even give them network access?"
