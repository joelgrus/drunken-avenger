In my younger days, when I was full of libertarian bluster, I used to
formulate arguments in terms of "Natural Rights." Murder was Wrong (with
a capital 'W') because it violated your "right to life." I used to go on
like this all day, until finally my friend Cesar (I think) kindly
pointed out that I was full of shit.

I'm still full of libertarian bluster, I suppose, although you'd never
in a million years catch me arguing based on "natural rights," which
(after my youthful indiscretions) I came to realize represent either
religious ("they're the rights god gave us") or pseudo-religious
("they're self-evident!") attempts to create an "objective" basis for
one's policy preferences. (As a general rule, if most people refuse to
agree with a proposition even after you've made your best case for it,
it's not "self-evident.")

There's no shortage of people who want an "objective" basis for their
policy preferences. It turns them from opinions (e.g. "it's my opinion
that we should pay teachers more") or hypothetical imperatives (e.g. "if
we want to make teaching a more attractive profession, we should pay
teachers more") or self-interest (e.g. "speaking as a teacher, we should
pay teachers more") into "facts" (e.g. "it's a fact that we should pay
teachers more") and "morals" (e.g. "if you don't think we should pay
teachers more, you're a moral reprobate"). You can argue against
opinions, but you can't argue against facts! You can rail against
self-interest, but not against morals!

It's a nice sleight of hand when you can pull it off. Unfortunately, you
usually can't. Neither can Sam Harris, who has a new book out claiming
that "science has a universal moral code."

The book's not quite out yet, but he's posted [an
excerpt](http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-10-02/sam-harris-on-the-moral-landscape/full/)
online.

Since it's Sam Harris, his purpose is of course to debunk one of the
arguments for god:

> The defense one most often hears for belief in God is not that there
> is compelling evidence for His existence, but that faith in Him is the
> only reliable source of meaning and moral guidance.

It's true that this is sometimes offered (I wouldn't say "most often")
as a defense of religon. In [my own
book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982481802?ie=UTF8&tag=brightwalton-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0982481802)
it's addressed in chapter 85: "But without religion..."

> Some people argue that religion is a necessary source of morality, and
> that if people all realized their religions were false, they would no
> longer have any incentives to fly airplanes into skyscrapers, to chop
> off the tips of their babies' penises, to restrict poor people's
> access to contraception, to censor cartoons, to make it difficult to
> purchase liquor on Sundays, to stone homosexuals, or to murder
> apostates and heathens. Society, they argue, would subsequently break
> down.

Of course, the sensible's person rejoinder to this is that the *truth*
of a belief is independent of its *consequences*. And anyway we don't
need an *absolute* morality, we just need a set of rules to help us get
along. We don't want to be murdered, and we don't want our friends and
neighbors to be murdered, so we outlaw murder and we punish murderers.
We (ideally) enact new rules if they seem necessary and (ideally) repeal
them if they seem counterproductive. There's no need to embarrass
ourselves by dragging philosophy into things and trying to make
metaphysical statements about murder in the abstract.

It's disappointing, then, that Harris's klugy response is to advocate
for a "science" of morality. Science is (among other things) a spirit of
inquiry. If you're serious about using science to solve a problem, then
you're committing to accepting science's answer *whatever it turns out
to be*.

If you believe that science can make a statement that (say) child abuse
is wrong in some absolute sense, then you're tacitly accepting that new
evidence might reveal that child abuse is not actually wrong. If you're
not open to that possibility, then **you're not doing science**. You can
call it science, but it's not science.

Maybe he doesn't care. (Or maybe he's open to the possibility that child
abuse might be "moral," but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.)
Maybe he's only interested in the name:

> But whether morality becomes a proper branch of science is not really
> the point. Is economics a true science yet?

I'm not sure whether economics is a "true science." But most honest
economists are forthright that the scientific part of what they do is
only the [positive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_economics)
part. Economics can tell you which allocation rules satisfy certain
"fairness" criteria. But it can't tell you which criteria are the
*correct* ones.

Look, I think murder is awful. But I don't pretend that this is some
sort of scientific judgment. It's my opinion, and luckily most everyone
else agrees with me.

You know what else is awful? Putting people in jail because they like to
use drugs. It's wicked, it's evil, it's barbaric, it's disgusting, it's
shameful, it's every bad adjective you could apply to it. This is as
plainly obvious to me as is my feeling that murder is awful. And I'm not
just talking marijuana. I'm talking heroin, cocaine, opium, you name it.
Somehow, though, most people disagree with me. Most *scientific* people
disagree with me. Of course, I'm right and they're wrong. But science is
powerless to settle this dispute. Science tells you *what drugs do* and
*what happens when you mix them* and *how to get a better high*. Science
tells you the likely consequences of your policy of throwing drug users
in prison. But science doesn't tell you whether it's *evil* to throw
drug users in prison. Science **can't** tell you whether it's evil to
throw drug users in prison. Science can't tell you how to find "peaks"
on a "moral landscape" because there's no such thing as a "moral
landscape."

This isn't a problem unless you decide to start worrying about the
bizarrely abstract:

> Imagine how terrifying it would be if great numbers of smart people
> became convinced that all efforts to prevent a global financial
> catastrophe, being mere products of culture, must be either equally
> valid or equally nonsensical in principle. And yet this is precisely
> where most intellectuals stand on the most important questions in
> human life.

I've puzzled over this section for a long time, and I can't make the
slightest sense of it. Whether you're evaluating "efforts to prevent a
catastrophe" or "the most important questions in human life," you ought
to be concerned with *practical* things like "whether they'll work" and
"what side effects they'll have" and "how much they'll cost." Worrying
which ones are "valid in principle" (whatever on earth that means) is a
perfect way to waste time and not solve anything. Not unlike the new
Harris book, I suspect.
