Due to a combination of carelessness, disorganization, and ineptitude, I
let my domain expire a couple of years ago.  For many dark months, it
pointed at a page of useless ads that I can't imagine anyone being
willing to click on.

Recently I checked and discovered that it was about to expire, and so I
entered into an "auction" to get it back.  Armed with my economics
degree and my copy of [*Auction
Theory*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123745071?ie=UTF8&tag=brightwalton-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0123745071),
I proceeded to grossly overbid, at which point I got my domain back.

Now, what should I do with it?
