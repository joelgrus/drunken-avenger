Today is my last day at Microsoft, as I will be leaving to pursue my
boyhood dream of ~~eating the world's biggest hoagie~~ becoming a famous
author someday. I'm sure you have many questions about this move, many
of which I've preemptively answered below:

**Frequently Asked Questions**

Q: Really?\
 A: Really.

Q: Aren't you already a famous author?\
 A: While I do get famous-author levels of hate mail, I fall short by
most other metrics.

Q: Do famous authors even make enough money to survive?\
 A: Not unless they write about love triangles involving vampires and
werewolves.

Q: What's your next book about?\
 A: I'm thinking a love triangle involving a vampire and a werewolf.

Q: Isn't that market kind of saturated?\
 A: That's why my book is going to be in 3-D.

Q: You mean like a pop-up book?\
 A: No, although that's not a bad idea.

Q: How can a book be in 3-D?\
 A: We're still figuring that part out.

Q: Well, what can I do to help?\
 A: If you buy a copy of [my first
book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982481802?ie=UTF8&tag=brightwalton-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0982481802),
that would help me afford food for my kids.

Q: You have kids?\
 A: For my *metaphorical* kids, I mean.

Q: What's a "metaphorical kid"?\
 A: This interview is over!

Anyway, exciting times are ahead, and I plan to chronicle them right
here, so stay tuned!
