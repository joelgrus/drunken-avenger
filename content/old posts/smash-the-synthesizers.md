Slug: smash-the-synthesizers

There's a scourge stalking Broadway. It's called the "synthesizer," and
it uses "technology" to generate sounds that heretofore could only be
generated by human "musicians." And like other human-supplanting devices
such as [mechanized looms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite), [grain
threshers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshing_machine#Early_social_impacts),
and [sex robots](http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10432597-1.html),
the "synthesizer" must be stopped.

So warns violinist [Paul
Woodiel](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/opinion/11woodiel.html), who
is quite sure that Leonard Bernstein would have been at the head of the
smashing line:

Indeed, it would be pretty unfair to deceive audiences that way. If we
grant the producers this one deceit, they're sure to follow it with
others. Next they'll replace the story's gang members with "actors" only
*pretending* to be gang members. Instead of expensive real guns, they'll
probably start using prop guns that only *pretend* to fire bullets.
Heck, they might even start faking some of the deaths in the play!

Better just to pull the plug:

That's a pretty forceful statement, that he and all his co-musicians and
all the actors and all the stagehands and the directors and costumers
are all offering to quit their jobs in order to fight off big King
Synthesizer. All of the co-musicians and actors and stagehands and
directors and costumers are on-board with his crusade, right?
