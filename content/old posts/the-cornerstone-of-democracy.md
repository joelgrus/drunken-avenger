Most towns have some sort of "school board," which is tasked with
deciding which subjects need to have Biblically-influenced syllabi,
taking kickbacks from textbook publishers, and not firing incompetent
and/or criminally negligent teachers.

They run for election every few years, filling our medians with campaign
signs festooned with grade-school-evocative clip-art like apples and
rulers and dunce hats. Their voter's guide blurbs affirm their
commitments to teacher-unionism, to social promotion, to eco-awareness,
and to our children.

In Denver, it turns out, they have an additional responsibility:
[entering into financially catastrophic \$750 million derivatives
contracts with JPMorgan Chase in order to shore up massively
overpromised pension

In retrospect, it's easy to see how a bunch of educators and
schoolparents got taken for a ride by some Wall Street salesguys with
slick PowerPoint presentations whose area of expertise is taking people
for a ride with slick PowerPoint presentations. Luckily, it's not
actually *their* money at stake, and the people of Denver (some of whom
likely have kids in the school system) ought to be happy to pony up for
the difference.

After all, half-billion-dollar loans to pay pensions to former employees
of the public school system are the cornerstone of democracy.
