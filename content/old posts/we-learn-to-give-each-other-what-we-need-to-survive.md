If there's one thing we've learned from the song "Ebony and Ivory," it's
that people are the same wherever we go. Alas, the educational
establishment has been reluctant to embrace this truism, insisting on
people-are-the-same-wherever-we-go-denying practices like
[tracking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_%28education%29) and
[electives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_%28education%29#Required_and_elective_courses),
and (grudgingly) allowing [charter
schools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school) a limited degree
of "autonomy," which is just a fancy word for "not following all the
rules that our wiser-than-everyone-else education officials, in their
near-infinite wisdom, insist that we follow."

Signs are showing, however, that this is changing. First, brave pioneers
like Texas are demonstrating the wisdom of [a centrally-planned
curriculum](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2010/03/10/national/a000529S94.DTL):

> Teachers in Texas will be required to cover the Judeo-Christian

> philosophical rationale for the separation of church and state.
> Curriculum standards also will describe the U.S. government as a
> "constitutional republic," rather than "democratic," and students will

> including the abandonment of the gold standard.

> Republican [Terri
> Leo](http://ednews.org/articles/darwin-would-not-have-supported-censorship.html),
> a member of the powerful Christian conservative voting bloc, called
> the standards "world class" and "exceptional."

Indeed, it's probably dangerous and/or irrelevant to teach kids about
antiquated topics like "separation of church and state." And how can you
be a good citizen if you don't learn the story of how George Washington
was driving on the freeway one day and then broke down in tears and
pulled over to the side of the road and accepted Jesus Christ as his
Lord and Savior? It sounds like they also have pretty good plan to make
sure that "world history" actually covers the *entire*
several-thousand-year history of the world. (Unfortunately, it sounds
like they *still* don't have a plan to avoid spending way more time than
scheduled on the Civil War and then end up having to cram all of
post-World-War-II history into the last week of the school year.)

Nonetheless, this plan isn't perfect. For instance, it only applies to
children in Texas. Why should the kids in Washington and Alabama and
North Dakota and Iowa be denied the benefits of a Terri-Leo-approved,
one-size-fits-all education?

Luckily, governors and "education leaders" [are on the same
page](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gwpX_yd20tDDMYrOh15YmToZHJ8QD9EC3FO00):

> Governors and education leaders on Wednesday proposed sweeping new
> school standards that could lead to students across the country using
> the same math and English textbooks and taking the same tests,
> replacing a patchwork of state and local systems in an attempt to
> raise student achievement nationwide.

One small sticking point seems to be that the good people of Texas,
enamored of their seemingly-already-perfect system, are reluctant to
throw their lot in with the other 49 states.

Nonetheless, the logic is inescapable. If one unified curriculum for all
students in Texas is good, one unified curriculum for all students in
the country is even better. Sure, some naysayers might claim that
"different students learn differently" or "trying a variety of things
could help us figure out what works best" or "there's a chance that
wingnuts could capture a centralized process and force a completely
wingnut curriculum on everyone," but (as was made clear in the song
"Ebony and Ivory") those are pretty weak objections.

And in the end, it's hard to imagine that the Texas School Board won't
give in to logic. Which leaves us only with the issue of getting *[Your

enthroned as part of the national-standard eighth-grade required
reading. Can somebody introduce me to Arne Duncan?
