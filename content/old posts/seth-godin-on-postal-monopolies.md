Seth Godin discovers that stamps.com is trying to scam him out of money
and
[asks](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/06/a-bias-for-scamminess.html):

> How is that a sleepy, conservative organization like the postal
> service ends up licensing its brand to a company that can't resist

I probably would have guessed something the lines of "their
[monopoly](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.02/view.html?pg=2)
gives them little incentive to treat their customers well" or "they're
[desperate for
revenue](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/02/AR2010030200912.html?hpid=topnews)
in a changing industry" or "what do you expect from the same
organization that [expects me to donate
food](http://www.usps.com/communications/community/fooddrive.htm) to my
~~mailman~~ letter carrier every year?"

Godin (whom I generally adore, by the way) suggests instead that

> There's something about the mechanics and arms-length nature of the
> web that just begs companies that know better to treat people in a way
> that they'd be humiliated to try face to face.

This might even be true, although one also could make the opposite
argument that the arms-length nature of the web makes it *easier* to
treat people well, which everyone knows is plenty challenging in person
(at least for me).
