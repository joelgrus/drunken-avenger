I've attended two schools with honor codes. At Rice, where I was an
undergrad, we used to [pledge in
writing](http://www.futureowls.rice.edu/futureowls/Honor_Code.asp?SnID=2)
not to cheat on exams, all the while taking an in-retrospect-bizarre
pride that the "honor code" (and by extension "honor") applied only to
schoolwork and not to (for example) pub nights or cast parties.

Serious accusations of cheating resulted in trials whose
[abstracts](http://honor.rice.edu/abstracts.cfm) were publicly posted,
with enough identifying details redacted so that you could never be sure
which ~~student-athlete~~ student or course was being written about.
Usually you could guess, though, and if someone unexpectedly disappeared
for a semester or two, that was a good signal you were right. To the
extent I thought about it, I guess I assumed the honor system worked
pretty well.

The Caltech [honor
code](http://www.facultyguide.caltech.edu/honor_code.htm) is a bit more
reasonable (to my mind), in that it specifies that "no member of the
Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the
community." Alas, I attended Caltech as a grad student in *economics*,
perhaps the only academic field in which cynicism is integral to the
methodology. Unlike their counterparts in other departments, economics
professors behaved (and tested, as much as they could) as if their
students had no honor code at all.

Anyway, I never bothered reconciling the two positions. My guess is that
some students are going to cheat either way, some aren't going to cheat
either way, and the honor code makes some difference at the margin. I
also suspect that an honor code raises the cost of *collaborative*
cheating ("[three may keep a
secret...](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/27739.html)") relative to
*individual* cheating (e.g. looking in the book when you're not supposed
to, surfing the web for answers, and so on), shifting behavior
accordingly.

One solution to "the cheating problem" is some version of Bentham's
[panopticon](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/06/education/06cheat.html):

> No gum is allowed during an exam: chewing could disguise a student’s
> speaking into a hands-free cellphone to an accomplice outside.
>
> [...]
>
> When a proctor sees something suspicious, he records the student’s
> real-time work at the computer and directs an overhead camera to zoom
> in, and both sets of images are burned onto a CD for evidence.

But if you are a good-hearted person, whenever someone insists that a
police state is the only way to solve a certain problem (\*cough\*
[SSSCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSSCA) \*cough\*) you ought to
spend some time thinking about whether the problem is itself so bad. Is
it so terrible when people get outside help solving their problems?

After all, when I run into problems getting Python to talk to Oracle, or
getting LaTeX to typeset my manuscript, no one insists that I figure out
the problem on my own. I'm allowed to talk to people and ask questions
and see if someone has already solved the problem. In an academic
setting these might be "cheating" but in a real-world setting they're
how people get things done.

That doesn't mean that the ability to solve problems without outside
help isn't valuable. For some (but not all) problems it is, and it's not
that unreasonable that you'd want to test for it. (I am skeptical that
proctored exams in the surveillance prison are doing this, but the
article doesn't give enough detail to say.)

Anyway, rather than forcing people to take examinations naked and
gumless so that we can place them into carefully bell-curved buckets, we
might consider less-amenable-to-cheating ways to simply give them a
thumbs-up or thumbs-down. Oral examinations, for instance, ought to be
tougher to cheat on and are probably a much better gauge of what
students have learned and understood. (On the other hand, they're much
more work for teachers, and they don't facilitate meaningless,
fine-grained distinctions between students, so they'll probably never
happen.)

Of course, if you ask questions like "why have grades at all?" you tend
to get dismissed as a heretic and burned at the stake. (Also, the
[schools that opt for this
approach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States#De-emphasis_of_grades)
are mostly dirty hippie colleges that you'd never want to be associated
with, which probably scares people away from this point of view.)

Nonetheless, one of the primal fitness blogs I read [wrote along these
lines](http://freetheanimal.com/2010/07/school-inc-race-to-nowhere.html)
recently:

> While all are working within the system -- in many cases very

> You shouldn't care.\

You can't imagine doing this, can you?

And perhaps the most heretical approach of all is to ask, "[Why
school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling)?" But I've said too
much.
