I like to give talks on a wide variety of subjects. If you'd like me to
give a talk at your event, meetup, roast, or funeral, please get in
touch!

Here are some talks I have given:

Technical
---------

### T-Shirts, Feminism, Parenting, and Data Science

A lightning talk for the "Seattle Data, Analytics, and Machine Learning"
meetup.

### F\# for Startups

I gave the first version of this talk at the ".NET Startup" meetup
group, then an improved version at the "Seattle F\#" meetup group
([slides](http://www.slideshare.net/joelgrus/f-for-startups-v2))

### Secrets of Fire Truck Society

What can we learn about the lives of fire trucks by studying their
social networks? Given at the Ignite at Strata 2013.
([slides](http://www.slideshare.net/joelgrus/joel-grus-secretsoffiretrucksociety),
supposedly they also took a video but I've never seen it)

Non-Technical
-------------

### Hitler Loved Patents

The case against intellectual property, given at BIL 2012 (low-quality
cellphone [video](http://vimeo.com/38745387))

### How to be Funny

Given at Ignite Seattle, marred by technical difficulties.
([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVat9hq964)) I gave a better
(longer) version at BIL 2011, but there's no video for it.

### Your Religion is False

Just what it sounds like, delivered at the BIL conference in 2009.
