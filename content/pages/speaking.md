I like to give talks on a wide variety of subjects. If you'd like me to
give a talk at your event, meetup, roast, or funeral, please get in
touch!

Here are some talks I have given:

### Data Science: A Vision of Things to Come

In which I try to predict the future of data science.
This was a keynote at the 2020 Southern Data Science Conference. 
[<a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11-4j2YpiY7iMwCxgaHUF0s6uFTJF-TKIBPWzkRf5BIY/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>]

### Managing Junior Data Scientists in the Time of Coronavirus

I am trying to branch out and give talks that are less purely technical. 
(They're easier to write.) This one was at IBM Learn AI 2020.
[<a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PoKysoyHAEOqPJlfich-I5vJ-60UtlQu2Repu92RIZc/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>]


### Reproducibility as a Vehicle for Engineering Best Practices

Invited talk at the ICLR 2019 Workshop on "Reproducibility in ML". [<a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yHLPvPhUs2KGI5ZWo0sU-PKU3GimAk3iTsI38Z-B5Gw/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>]

### Modern NLP for Pre-Modern Practioners

This was the opening keynote for QCon.ai 2019. It's a whirlwind tour
of all the new hotness in NLP. [<a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iX0fODe0YzPg4Ak-pNqO1KiyF3INgv-Zne27XFSlu1s/edit">slides</a>]

### If Not Notebooks, Then What?

Invited talk at the AAAI 2019 "Workshop on Reproducible AI". [<a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ivK8AKgz8Hx-ZYzPC9gJyQK6tzuhR3UuhCEajFGJDlA/edit">slides</a>]

### Writing Code for NLP Research

A tutorial at EMNLP 2019 that I gave along with two of my teammates.
Due to a baggage-handlers strike at Brussels Airport (really!) it wasn't recorded. [<a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17NoJY2SnC2UMbVegaRCWA7Oca7UCZ3vHnMqBV4SUayc/edit">slides</a>]

### Fizz Buzz in Tensorflow

I've given this talk several times: at WrangleConf 2016, at PyData Chicago 2016,
and at ODSC West 2016. The ODSC version was the best, but I don't think there's
a video of it. Here are <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16aTSekqJdF-WjxymEnfiNvJI-StY0deCYBWiZxhPbyI/edit">the slides</a> though.

### How Becoming Not a Data Scientist Made Me a Better Data Scientist

Thoughts on why data scientists should care about software engineering best practices,
from the 2018 Southern Data Science Conference. [<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jk-qrVKCb0-P9P4BVzH75gcVhp5Dy5n1CP_gKnHMNY0/edit">slides</a>]

### I Don't Like Notebooks

From JupyterCon 2018 (really!). This talk is possibly what I'm most famous for. If you like memes this is the talk for you. [<a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI/edit#slide=id.g362da58057_0_1">slides</a>]

### Fun with Trump Tweets

I gave this talk at the Twitter Developers Seattle meetup in late 2016, about
two fun projects I did with Trump-related tweets. There's definitely not a video
of this, but you can look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UqbMkki1sY7ivgxcWNhWtTETsuWTIJ6V8OMPQNwAUC0/edit?usp=sharing">the slides</a>.

### The Joy of [Python 3.5-style] Type Hints

I pitched this to PyCon 2017, but it got rejected. So instead I used it as a
last-minute fill in at a PyLadies Seattle meetup in January 2017. No video, but
here are <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12IkXSEnkxPy0DvS4jxTVZ7H9RGbQa-F3qyNuV-aa_hg/edit?usp=sharing">the slides</a>.

### How to Teach (and Learn) Data Science

I have given variations on this talk many times:
at the Seattle DAML Meetup, at the CareerBuilder data science summit,
and at Data Day Texas 2016. I don't think there's a video of it,
but <a href = "https://twitter.com/joelgrus/status/688501541850841088">the slides are out there</a>.

### Learning Data Science Using Functional Python (aka Stupid Itertools Tricks)

This was originally supposed to be a variation on the previous talk,
but it got away from me and turned into a crazy digression on
lazy infinite sequences in Python. This is a pretty fun talk.

<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThS4juptJjQ">video</a>
<a href = "https://github.com/joelgrus/stupid-itertools-tricks-pydata">slides / code</a>

### Image Posterization Using k-means Clustering (Workshop)

This was a <a href = "https://github.com/joelgrus/posterization-pyladies">hands-on workshop</a>
I ran for the Seattle PyLadies, wherein we implemented k-means clustering
from scratch and used it to "posterize" images.

### T-Shirts, Feminism, Parenting, and Data Science

A lightning talk for the "Seattle Data, Analytics, and Machine Learning"
meetup. There's no video of it, but I wrote up a two part blog post
(<a href="https://joelgrus.com/2013/06/19/t-shirts-feminism-parenting-and-data-science-part-1-colors/">part 1</a> <a href = "https://joelgrus.com/2013/06/24/t-shirts-feminism-parenting-and-data-science-part-2-eigenshirts/">part 2</a>)

### F\# for Startups

I gave the first version of this talk at the ".NET Startup" meetup
group, then an improved version at the "Seattle F\#" meetup group
([slides](http://www.slideshare.net/joelgrus/f-for-startups-v2))

### Secrets of Fire Truck Society

What can we learn about the lives of fire trucks by studying their
social networks? Given at the Ignite at Strata 2013.

I finally found the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoS6ODOqZm0">video</a> of it,
the reason I never could is because the description says the speaker
is "Mick Thompson", but it's definitely me.
