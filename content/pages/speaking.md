I like to give talks on a wide variety of subjects. If you'd like me to
give a talk at your event, meetup, roast, or funeral, please get in
touch!

Here are some talks I have given:

Technical
---------

### How to Teach (and Learn) Data Science

I have given variations on this talk many times:
at the Seattle DAML Meetup, at the CareerBuilder data science summit,
and at Data Day Texas 2016. I don't think there's a video of it,
but <a href = "https://twitter.com/joelgrus/status/688501541850841088">the slides are out there</a>.

### Learning Data Science Using Functional Python (aka Stupid Itertools Tricks)

This was originally supposed to be a variation on the previous talk,
but it got away from me and turned into a crazy digression on
lazy infinite sequences in Python. This is a pretty fun talk.

### Image Posterization Using k-means Clustering (Workshop)

This was a <a href = "https://github.com/joelgrus/posterization-pyladies">hands-on workshop</a>
I ran for the Seattle PyLadies, wherein we implemented k-means clustering
from scratch and used it to "posterize" images.

### T-Shirts, Feminism, Parenting, and Data Science

A lightning talk for the "Seattle Data, Analytics, and Machine Learning"
meetup. There's no video of it, but I wrote up a two part blog post
(<a href="http://joelgrus.com/2013/06/19/t-shirts-feminism-parenting-and-data-science-part-1-colors/">part 1</a> <a href = "http://joelgrus.com/2013/06/24/t-shirts-feminism-parenting-and-data-science-part-2-eigenshirts/">part 2</a>)

### F\# for Startups

I gave the first version of this talk at the ".NET Startup" meetup
group, then an improved version at the "Seattle F\#" meetup group
([slides](http://www.slideshare.net/joelgrus/f-for-startups-v2))

### Secrets of Fire Truck Society

What can we learn about the lives of fire trucks by studying their
social networks? Given at the Ignite at Strata 2013.

I finally found the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoS6ODOqZm0">video</a> of it,
the reason I never could is because the description says the speaker
is "Mick Thompson", but it's definitely me.

Non-Technical
-------------

### Hitler Loved Patents

The case against intellectual property, given at BIL 2012 (low-quality
cellphone [video](http://vimeo.com/38745387))

### How to be Funny

Given at Ignite Seattle, marred by technical difficulties.
([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVat9hq964)) I gave a better
(longer) version at BIL 2011, but there's no video for it.

### Your Religion is False

Just what it sounds like, delivered at the BIL conference in 2009.
